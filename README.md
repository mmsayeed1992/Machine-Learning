# Machine-Learning
two main general ideas: supervised learning and unsupervised learning

In supervised learning, a set of already-known correct responses to already-seen inputs is provided, and is used to train the program to make correct responses to new inputs. For instance, a facial recognition program could be supplied with a number of photographs, each labeled with the name of the person in the image, and learn to recognize new images of those persons.

In unsupervised learning, a program seeks to find hitherto unknown patterns in data, without any pre-judgment about what those patterns might be. For example, a music recommendation program might try to find similarities between groups of songs, so that when a user likes one such song, others in its similar group can be recommended to them. The course looks at various computational and mathematical models and techniques that can be applied to such problems.
